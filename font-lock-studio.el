;; Interactive debugger for font-lock keywords (Emacs syntax
;; highlighting rules).
;;
;; Font Lock Studio lets you *single-step* Font Lock keywords --
;; matchers, highlights, and anchored rules, so that you can see what
;; happens when a buffer is fontified.  You can set *breakpoints* on
;; or inside rules and *run* until one has been hit.  When inside a
;; rule, matches are *visualized* using a palette of background
;; colors.  The *explainer* can describe a rule in plain-text English.
;; Tight integration with *Edebug* allows you to step into Lisp
;; expressions that are part of the Font Lock keywords.

;; Usage:
;;
;; When using the debugger, an *interface buffer* is displayed, it
;; contains all the keywords and is used for navigation and
;; visalization of match data.
;;
;; When Font Lock Studio is started, comments and strings are
;; pre-colored, as they are part of the earlier *syntactic phase*
;; (which isn't supported by Font Lock Studio).
;;
;; Start the debugger by typing `M-x font-lock-studio RET'.  Press `?'
;; or see the menu for available commands.
;;
;; Why use a debugger?:
;;
;; You might be the author of Font Lock keywords for a major more, you
;; might simply want to add your own personal highlighting rules, or
;; you simply would like to know more about how Font Lock keywords
;; work.
;;
;; Regardless of your background and ambition, there is a world of
;; difference between simply reading Font Lock keywords and being able
;; to step through the rules and exactly see what they do.  In fact, as
;; part of writing Font Lock Studio, I learned some new Font Lock
;; tricks from various major modes -- despite having 15+ years of
;; experience with Font Lock.

;; Example:
;;
;; For a buffer using `html-mode', the interface buffer looks the
;; following.  Other major modes typically have more and more complex
;; rules.  The arrow on the left indicates the current active location.
;; A corresponding arrow in the source buffer is placed at the current
;; search location.

;; on a highlight rule, which is part of a Font Lock keyword rule.
;;
;; ![See doc/demo.png for screenshot of Font Lock Studio](doc/demo.png)

;; Features:
;;
;; Stepping:
;;
;; You can single *step into*, *over*, and *out* of Font Lock
;; keywords.  *Anchored* rules are fully supported.  In addition, you
;; can *run* to the end or to the next breakpoint.
;;
;; Breakpoints:
;;
;; You can set breakpoints on part of the keyword, like the matcher
;; (e.g. the regexp), a highlight rule, or inside an anchored highlight
;; rule.
;;
;; If you want to step or run without stopping on breakpoints, prefix
;; the command with `C-u'.
;;
;; Note that in an anchored rule, you can set a breakpoints either on
;; the entire rule or on an individual part.  In the former case, only
;; the outer parentheses are highlighted.
;;
;; Match Data Visualization:
;;
;; After the *matcher* of a keyword or anchored highlight has been
;; executed, the match data (whatever the search found) is visualized
;; using background colors in the source buffer, in the regexp, and
;; over the corresponding highlight rule or rules.  If part of a regexp
;; or a highlight didn't match, it is not colored, this can for
;; example happen when the postfix regexp operator `?' is used.
;;
;; Note that an inner match group gets precedence over an outer group.
;; This can lead to situations where a highlight rule gets a color
;; that doesn't appear in the regexp or in the source buffer.  For
;; example, the matcher "\\(abc\\)" will be colored with the color for
;; match 1, while the higlight rule `(0 a-face)' gets the color for
;; match 0.
;;
;; Normalized keywords:
;;
;; The keywords presented in the interface have been normalized.  For
;; example, instead of
;;
;;      ("xyz" . font-lock-type-face)
;;
;; the keyword
;;
;;       ("xyz" (0 font-lock-type-face))
;;
;; is shown.  See `font-lock-studio-normalize-keywords' for details.
;;
;; Explainer:
;;
;; The *explainer* echoes a human-readble description of the current
;; part of the Font Lock keywords.  This help you to understand that
;; all those `nil':s and `t':s in the rules actually mean.
;;
;; When using the *auto explainer*, Font Lock Studio echoes the
;; explanation after each command.
;;
;; Edebug -- the Emacs Lisp debugger:
;;
;; Tight integration with Edebug allows you to single-step expressions
;; embedded in the keywords in the interface buffer, and it allows you
;; to instrument called functions for debugging in their source file.
;;
;; Follow mode awareness:
;;
;; The search location in the source buffer is visualized by an
;; overlay arrow and by updating the point.  If the source buffer is
;; visible in multiple side-by-side windows and Follow mode is
;; enabled, the search location will be shown in a suitable windows to
;; minimize scrolling.

;; Tips and trix:
;;
;; The "Hanging Emacs" problem:
;;
;; Traditionally, if you use a function as a matcher and that function
;; doesn't return -- Emacs hangs and all you can do is to kill it and
;; restart.  (I know from personal experience that it's not uncommon
;; for functions that parse text to hang -- for example, when you have
;; forgotten to check for the end-of-buffer.) When using font-lock
;; studio, you can simply press `C-q' to exit.
;;
;; If you have a source file that hangs Emacs when loaded, first
;; disable font-lock using `M-x global-font-lock-mode RET' before
;; loading the file, and finally launch Font-Lock studio.
;;
;; `cc-mode' keywords:
;;
;; The keywords provided by major modes like `c-mode', `objc-mode',
;; `cpp-mode' that are based on `cc-mode' contain *byte-compiled*
;; font-lock keywords, which are unreadable and undebugable.  To use
;; corresponding keywords with *uncompiled* code, copy the file
;; `cc-fonts.el', replace explicit calls to `byte-compile' with `eval'
;; and issue `M-x eval-buffer RET'.

;; Implementation overview:
;;
;; State-machine fontification engine:
;;
;; Font Lock Studio provides it's own fontification engine, designed
;; to for things needed by a debugger such as single-stepping and
;; breakpoints.  This fontification engine lacks a lot of features of
;; the real font-lock fontification engine, such as the speed and the
;; ability to refontify when the buffer is modified.
;;
;; The fontification engine can be used without an interface buffer.
;;
;; Regexp decomposer:
;;
;; In order for to visualize the groups in regexp:s that corresponds
;; to matches, they must be located.  This requires a non-trivial
;; *regexp parser*.

;; Other Font Lock Tools:
;;
;; This package is part of a suite of font-lock tools.  The other
;; tools in the suite are:
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Profiler:
;;
;; A profiler for font-lock keywords.  This package measures time and
;; counts the number of times each part of a font-lock keyword is
;; used.  For matchers, it counts the total number and the number of
;; successful matches.
;;
;; The result is presented in table that can be sorted by count or
;; time.  The table can be expanded to include each part of the
;; font-lock keyword.
;;
;; In addition, this package can generate a log of all font-lock
;; events.  This can be used to verify font-lock implementations,
;; concretely, this is used for back-to-back tests of the real
;; font-lock engine and Font Lock Studio, an interactive debugger for
;; font-lock keywords.
;;
;;
;; Highlight Refontification:
;;
;; Minor mode that visualizes how font-lock refontifies a buffer.
;; This is useful when developing or debugging font-lock keywords,
;; especially for keywords that span multiple lines.
;;
;; The background of the buffer is painted in a rainbow of colors,
;; where each band in the rainbow represent a region of the buffer
;; that has been refontified.  When the buffer is modified, the
;; rainbow is updated.
;;
;;
;; Faceup:
;;
;; Emacs is capable of highlighting buffers based on language-specific
;; `font-lock' rules.  This package makes it possible to perform
;; regression test for packages that provide font-lock rules.
;;
;; The underlying idea is to convert text with highlights ("faces")
;; into a plain text representation using the Faceup markup
;; language.  This language is semi-human readable, for example:
;;
;;     «k:this» is a keyword
;;
;; By comparing the current highlight with a highlight performed with
;; stable versions of a package, it's possible to automatically find
;; problems that otherwise would have been hard to spot.
;;
;; This package is designed to be used in conjunction with Ert, the
;; standard Emacs regression test system.
;;
;; The Faceup markup language is a generic markup language, regression
;; testing is merely one way to use it.
;;
;;
;; Face Explorer:
;;
;; Library and tools for faces and text properties.
;;
;; This library is useful for packages that convert syntax highlighted
;; buffers to other formats.  The functions can be used to determine
;; how a face or a face text property looks, in terms of primitive
;; face attributes (e.g. foreground and background colors).  Two sets
;; of functions are provided, one for existing frames and one for
;; fictitious displays, like 8 color tty.
;;
;; In addition, the following tools are provided:
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-faces' -- list all available faces.  Like
;;   `list-faces-display' but with information on how a face is
;;   defined.  In addition, a sample for the selected frame and for a
;;   fictitious display is shown.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-describe-face' -- Print detailed information on
;;   how a face is defined, and list all underlying definitions.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-describe-face-prop' -- Describe the `face' text
;;   property at the point in terms of primitive face attributes.
;;   Also show how it would look on a fictitious display.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-display-features' -- Show which features a
;;   display supports.  Most graphical displays support all, or most,
;;   features.  However, many tty:s don't support, for example,
;;   strike-through.  Using specially constructed faces, the resulting
;;   buffer will render differently in different displays, e.g. a
;;   graphical frame and a tty connected using `emacsclient -nw'.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-face-prop-examples' -- Show a buffer with an
;;   assortment of `face' text properties.  A sample text is shown in
;;   four variants: Native, a manually maintained reference vector,
;;   the result of `face-explorer-face-prop-attributes' and
;;   `face-explorer-face-prop-attributes-for-fictitious-display'.  Any
;;   package that convert a buffer to another format (like HTML, ANSI,
;;   or LaTeX) could use this buffer to ensure that everything work as
;;   intended.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-overlay-examples' -- Show a buffer with a
;;   number of examples of overlays, some are mixed with `face' text
;;   properties.  Any package that convert a buffer to another format
;;   (like HTML, ANSI, or LaTeX) could use this buffer to ensure that
;;   everything work as intended.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-tooltip-mode' -- Minor mode that shows tooltips
;;   containing text properties and overlays at the mouse pointer.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-simulate-display-mode' -- Minor mode for make a
;;   buffer look like it would on a fictitious display.  Using this
;;   you can, for example, see how a theme would look in using dark or
;;   light background, a 8 color tty, or on a grayscale graphical
;;   monitor.
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Regression Suite:
;;
;; A collection of example source files for a large number of
;; programming languages, with ERT tests to ensure that syntax
;; highlighting does not accidentally change.
;;
;; For each source file, font-lock reference files are provided for
;; various Emacs versions.  The reference files contains a plain-text
;; representation of source file with syntax highlighting, using the
;; format "faceup".
;;
;; Of course, the collection source file can be used for other kinds
;; of testing, not limited to font-lock regression testing.

;;; Code:

;; ----------------------------------------
;; Note: Everything above "Code" will be part of the GitHub README.md
;; file.

;; Naming convention:
;;
;; Source buffer    -- the buffer being fontified.
;;
;; Interface buffer -- the buffer containing the debugger interface.
;;
;; Control buffer   -- a buffer holding information about the
;;                     fontification using buffer-local variables,
;;                     typically the interface buffer. However, the
;;                     fontification engine can be used by itself, in
;;                     which case this can be any buffer including a
;;                     temporary buffer and the source buffer itself.

;; Known Problems:
;;
;; - Sometimes, the interface buffer is not displayed. (Could it be
;;   that it is first shown, then it tries to show the source buffer
;;   and it reuses the same window?)

;; Open issues:
;;
;; - Is C-u really a good idea for non-stop? It doesn't show up in the
;;   menu and C-h m. Maybe do something like "s" steps and "S" steps
;;   nonstop. (Note: There is no shifted space.)
;;
;; - A hidden compiled matched in an anchored rule without pre, post,
;;   and matcher (which is illegal, by the way) is rendered "(;;
;;   Compiled code (hidden))". This doesn't look that good as the
;;   closing parenthesis is drawn at the end of the comment. For now,
;;   I guess we can live with it. (See C mode for an example.)
;;
;; - Replace "predicate" with "form", to makes it easier to call.
;;   However, keeping the lambda construct makes it clearer that that
;;   it's a callback.
;;
;; - Maybe rename `font-lock-studio-fontify-step' to avoid confusion
;;   with the normal step commands. However, I need a good name,
;;   "tick-state-machine"?

;; Future ideas:
;;
;; - Support for debugging the "syntactic" font-lock phase.
;;
;; - Collect statistics, including timing information.
;;
;; - Disable rules. (Could use the same mechanism used by
;;   breakpoints.)
;;
;; - Breakpoints in source buffer.
;;
;; - Save and restore breakpoints.
;;
;; - Visualize when a keyword has been normalized.
;;
;; - Customize support.
;;
;; - Print code better (indented, font-locked, lambda and parameter
;;   list on the same line).
;;
;; - bind debug-on-error and debug-on-quit temporarily (like edebug does).

;; Random notes:
;;
;; Note on the syntax: Inside a backtick-lambda, "abc" is the value of
;; the expression "abc" at the time the lambda is called, and ",abc"
;; is the current value.
;;
;; Interface buffer:
;;
;; After each command, the interface buffer is erased and filled with
;; new content using a *renderer*. Or, rather, that is how it is
;; intended to work. However, when doing so, windows displaying the
;; buffer drop their start position. Instead, when the interface
;; buffer is drawn, it replaces the existing content line-by-line.
