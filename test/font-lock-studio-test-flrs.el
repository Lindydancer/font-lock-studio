;;; Commentary:

;; This is test for the package `font-lock-studio' using source code
;; provided by `font-lock-regression-suite', using the tools
;; `font-lock-profiler' and `faceup'.
;;
;; The test cases will fontify the source files with Font Lock Studio
;; and with the normal Font Lock engine and check that the result is
;; idnetical, and that each individual.
;;
;; The tests use the `ert' test framework, which is a part of Emacs.

;; Usage:
;;
;; Add test cases:
;;
;; `M-x font-lock-studio-test-flrs-add-ert-cases RET'.
;;
;; Run the test cases, for example:
;;
;; `M-x ert RET t RET'.

;;; Code:

(require 'font-lock-regression-suite)

;; TODO: Break out common code to a new file, say
;; `font-lock-studio-test-helper'.
(require 'font-lock-studio-test)
